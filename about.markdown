Matcha is a tool developed as part of a research project led by [Tianshi Li](https://tianshili.me) at Carnegie Mellon University. The design, implementation, and evaluation of the tool is adviced by faculty members at CMU including  [Jason Hong](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jasonh/), [Yuvraj Agarwal](https://www.synergylabs.org/yuvraj/index.html) and [Lorrie Cranor](https://lorrie.cranor.org).

Matcha does all its code analysis locally, and it doesn’t collect any data about your app. Its sensitive API detection and third-party SDK data use detection is intended to help you improve your understanding of your app's data collection and sharing practices and the results may not be exhaustive. You are responsible for verifying the generated CSV correctly represents your app’s data collection and sharing practices. The information provided on this website and in our tool is not intended to, and does not constitute legal advice.

Should you have any feedback or comment for the authors, please create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Matcha-IDE/Matcha-IDE/issues), or send an email to <tianshil@cs.cmu.edu>.
